/**
 * TLS Proxy for Bosch Smart Home Camera RTSPS streams.
 *
 * Bosch cameras expose RTSPS (RTSP-over-TLS) with a private CA certificate
 * that FFmpeg/go2rtc can't handle directly. This module creates a local TCP
 * server that accepts plain RTSP connections and forwards them over TLS to the
 * camera — stripping TLS from the consumer's perspective.
 *
 * Architecture (Node.js vs Python original):
 *   Python: threading.Thread + socket.select() + ssl.wrap_socket() per connection
 *   Node.js: net.createServer() + tls.connect() + stream.pipe() — no threads needed;
 *            Node's event loop and stream backpressure handle concurrency natively.
 *
 * Circuit breaker: after _MAX_BURST consecutive connect failures within
 * _BURST_WINDOW seconds, the server socket is closed. The coordinator must
 * rebuild the session when the camera becomes reachable again.
 *
 * Port of Python tls_proxy.py (Bosch-Smart-Home-Camera-Tool-HomeAssistant).
