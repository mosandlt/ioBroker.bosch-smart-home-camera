/**
 * RTSP session watchdog for LOCAL 24/7 streaming.
 *
 * Bosch LOCAL sessions have a maxSessionDuration (default 3600 s). After
 * expiry the camera closes the RTSPS stream — 24/7 recorders (BlueIris, etc.)
 * would see a drop every hour without proactive renewal.
 *
 * This watchdog schedules a renewal ~60 s before the session expires so the
 * TLS proxy keeps serving continuously. If LOCAL renewal fails, the stream
 * stops and the user is warned — no cloud-relay fallback, ever.
 *
 * Forum reference: ioBroker forum #84538 (Jaschkopf, BlueIris integration).
