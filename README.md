> All three projects share the same reverse-engineered Cloud API + RCP protocol research, but evolve independently. The Home Assistant integration is the most feature-complete reference implementation; the Python CLI is the lowest-level / scriptable surface; the ioBroker adapter is the youngest of the three and currently focused on the core states most users need for VIS dashboards and Blockly automations.

## Changelog

### 0.6.1 (2026-05-18)
Cleanup: removed legacy iOS FCM code paths aligned with HA integration v12.4.5.

- **`FCM_IOS_APP_ID` constant removed** — the adapter has used only the OSS-sanctioned Android Firebase key since its first release; the constant was dead code.
- **`mode: "ios"` dispatch chain removed** — `FcmListenerOptions.mode`, `FcmCredentials.mode`, and `FcmRawCredentials.mode` now accept `"android" | "auto"` only. `"auto"` is a direct alias for `"android"` (no iOS fallback).
- **`_registerWithCbs()` always posts `deviceType: "ANDROID"`** — the `"IOS"` branch is gone.
- **Legacy-creds back-compat**: users who stored credentials with `mode: "ios"` from a hypothetical pre-cleanup install will have their persisted mode rewritten to `"android"` on first start — no re-registration triggered.

### 0.6.0 (2026-05-16)
Security hardening + reliability round. Prepares the codebase for the official ioBroker repository PR.

- **OAuth tokens + PKCE secrets are AES-encrypted at rest** via the ioBroker system secret. Before v0.6.0, anyone with read access to the adapter namespace could see the 30-day `refresh_token` in plaintext via the Admin Objects tab. Migration is automatic on first start: any plaintext value found in `info.access_token` / `info.refresh_token` / `info.pkce_verifier` / `info.pkce_state` is re-written in encrypted form transparently.
- **FCM credentials persisted across restarts** (`info.fcm_creds`, encrypted). Previously every adapter start triggered a full re-registration: fresh ECDH key pair, fresh ACG id, fresh CBS `POST /v11/devices`. Now the listener replays the saved credentials and skips the handshake — saves ~1 s startup latency and a round-trip.
- **Camera-state poll runs per-camera in parallel** (`Promise.all`). With 4 cameras the per-tick wall-clock drops from ~N × 250 ms to ~250 ms. Each camera owns its own DP namespace, so concurrent writes don't race.
- **Timer hygiene**: `motion_active` auto-clear (90 s) and snapshot-idle teardown (60 s) now use adapter-core's `this.setTimeout` / `this.clearTimeout`, so adapter unload cancels them reliably.
- **Snapshot-saved log line is now `debug`** (was `info`) — it was firing on every motion event and flooding logs on busy installations.
- **+51 unit tests** covering the new encryption paths, FCM credential persistence, livestream toggle teardown, event processing dedup, siren / wallwasher handlers, idle teardown window, and reachability tracker. 436 tests total, 0 failing.
- **README cleaned** for the ioBroker repository PR: localised product names normalised to English, duplicate Changelog section merged into a single block, admin icon scaled to 200×200, Node 24 added to the CI matrix.

### 0.5.5 (2026-05-16)
Two forum-driven bugfixes reported against v0.5.4 on the ioBroker forum (post #1339866).

- **`motion_active` now flips on the FCM-polling-fallback path** (`info.fcm_active="polling"`). The shared post-event helper (`_onMotionFired()`, introduced in v0.5.3) was only being called by the real FCM event handler and the synthetic motion trigger — not by `fetchAndProcessEvents()`, the `/v11/events` polling loop the adapter runs when FCM registration fails. Affected users saw `last_motion_at` update correctly on every motion / person / audio_alarm event while `motion_active` stayed permanently `false`, breaking Blockly automations that listened for the rising edge. The polling path now calls the same helper, so the 90 s auto-clear timer and the auto-snapshot side-effects fire identically on both push and pull.
- **Light state now syncs back from the Bosch app**. The 30 s state poll (added in v0.5.1 for `privacy_enabled` sync) already fetched `/lighting/switch` on every tick for Gen2 cameras with `featureSupport.light=true` — but only wrote the brightness and colour into `wallwasher_brightness` / `wallwasher_color`. The boolean on/off DPs (`front_light_enabled`, `wallwasher_enabled`) were never derived from the response, so app-side light toggles stayed invisible to ioBroker until the next adapter restart. The poll now derives `front_light_enabled` from `frontLightSettings.brightness > 0` and `wallwasher_enabled` from `max(topLed, bottomLed) brightness > 0`, so app toggles propagate within ~30 s. No new HTTP call; the data was already on the wire. Gen1 cameras (Eyes Outdoor, 360°) are unchanged — `/lighting_override` is not polled today, so app-side toggles on Gen1 still wait for the next adapter restart.

### 0.5.4 (2026-05-15)
Login UX overhaul plus three small quality fixes the live-test surfaced.

- **One-click Bosch login button** in the instance settings (Forum #84538 feedback). The browser-OAuth URL is now also published as the `info.login_url` datapoint and rendered as a clickable link in the Admin UI — no more fishing the 300-char URL out of the log inspector. The new **Open Bosch Login in browser** button opens the URL directly in a new tab via the adapter's `getLoginUrl` sendTo handler. Once login succeeds, both the link and the button hide themselves.
- **No more terminate/restart loop while waiting for login**. If a stale `redirect_url` or an expired PKCE pair causes the code exchange to fail, the adapter now clears the stale state, regenerates a fresh login URL, sets `info.connection_status=auth_error`, and stays alive in awaiting-login mode. Previously the adapter terminated on every restart attempt, making it look broken in the instance overview.
- **Reset-login button**: new `Reset login (clear tokens & restart)` button (with confirmation prompt) in the instance settings. Wipes access/refresh tokens, PKCE pair, redirect_url and login_url in one click, then restarts the adapter to begin a fresh OAuth flow. Useful when a user is stuck or wants to switch to a different Bosch account.
- **`info.connection_status` text state** (`logged_out` | `awaiting_login` | `connected` | `auth_error`) — richer diagnostics for Blockly and VIS dashboards than the existing `info.connection` boolean.
- **`info.last_login_at` ISO timestamp** of the most recent successful token mint (fresh login or silent refresh). Helps gauge how close the refresh_token is to the ~30-day offline_access expiry.
- **Privacy mode no longer flips `online=false`**: an indoor camera in permanent privacy mode used to drift offline after a few startup-snapshot retries. The reachability tracker now treats privacy refusals as a user state, not a connectivity failure (Forum #84538 confused-state report).
- **`last_motion_at` is now valid ISO 8601**: Bosch sends timestamps in Java's `ZonedDateTime#toString` format (`2026-05-15T06:51:47.604+02:00[Europe/Berlin]`). The trailing `[zone-id]` broke `new Date()`. The adapter now strips it so Blockly scripts and VIS widgets can parse the field with standard tooling. Note: existing automations reading the raw string will see one less trailing token; numeric comparisons via `new Date(…).getTime()` start working from this release.
- **Snapshot keep-alive documentation honesty**: the v0.5.3 release notes claimed *~200 ms* warm-burst latency. Live measurements on Gen2 Eyes Outdoor II showed 2–5 s typical, occasionally 10–15 s — the camera's own snapshot endpoint dominates the round-trip, not the Bosch session-open. The wall-clock saving from the cached session is ~0.5–1 s (the avoided `PUT /v11/.../connection`). Updated wording in this release.

### 0.5.3 (2026-05-14)
Five forum-driven improvements — focused on the BlueIris / NVR-recorder integration story.

- **RTSP-aware proxy with transparent Digest auth (fixes forum #84538 BlueIris Error 8000007a)**: the TLS proxy now speaks RTSP and handles the Bosch Digest auth dance itself. Clients (BlueIris, iobroker.cameras, Frigate, …) connect to a clean `rtsp://host:port/rtsp_tunnel?inst=1&…` URL — **no credentials in the URL anymore**. The proxy parses the first 401 challenge from the camera, computes the response, swallows the 401, and injects an `Authorization: Digest …` header on every subsequent client request. Back-compat: clients that already send their own `Authorization` header (legacy in-URL creds path, VLC after a 401) are byte-piped through unchanged. Jaschkopf no longer needs to enter Digest credentials in BlueIris's own fields.
- **Snapshot session keep-alive (60 s idle window)**: rapid `snapshot_trigger` bursts (a Card opening, an automation polling every 5 s, a blockly script) reuse the warm Bosch session instead of paying `PUT /v11/.../connection` on every snap. Saves daily LOCAL session quota; the wall-clock saving per burst-snap is ~0.5–1 s (the `PUT /connection` round-trip) — the rest of the latency (~2–5 s typical, occasional 10–15 s when the camera is busy with its own motion engine) comes from the camera's snapshot endpoint itself and is not adapter-side.
- **`cameras.<id>.motion_active`** (new, boolean, read-only): edge-trigger DP, flips `true` on every motion / person / audio event, auto-clears to `false` after 90 s of no further events. Gives Blockly automations the clean rising/falling edge the existing `last_motion_at` timestamp doesn't provide.
- **`cameras.<id>.last_event_image`** + **Auto-snapshot on motion**: every FCM motion / person / audio_alarm event now fetches a fresh JPEG and writes it as a `data:image/jpeg;base64,…` string to `last_event_image` (plus matching `last_event_image_at` timestamp). Ready for Telegram / Signal / Matrix push automations without scripting. Toggle in new admin tab **Events / Notifications** (`auto_snapshot_on_motion`, default ON).
- **`cameras.<id>.stream_url_sub`** (new, experimental): sub-stream URL via `inst=2` alongside the main `inst=1` `stream_url`. Same Bosch session, same TLS proxy, zero extra quota cost. Lets BlueIris record the main stream while displaying the lower-bitrate substream for CPU savings. Depends on the camera firmware actually serving `inst=2` (Gen2 Eyes typically does; Gen1 may not).

### 0.5.2 (2026-05-14)
Per-camera livestream switch — default OFF.

- **`cameras.<id>.livestream_enabled`** (new, boolean, writable, default `false`): explicit on/off switch for the continuous RTSP livestream. Previous behaviour opened a 24/7 Bosch LOCAL session + TLS proxy + RTSP watchdog on every adapter start — one open session per camera, consuming the daily LOCAL session quota even when nobody was watching the stream. Streaming is now opt-in:
  - **Write `true`** → adapter calls `PUT /v11/video_inputs/{id}/connection`, spawns the TLS proxy on the sticky port, arms the RTSP watchdog (renews ~60 s before `maxSessionDuration` so external recorders see no drop), and populates `cameras.<id>.stream_url` with the digest-credentials URL.
  - **Write `false`** → watchdog cancelled, TLS proxy stopped, Bosch session closed via `DELETE /v11/video_inputs/{id}/connection`, `stream_url` cleared.
- **Snapshots remain unaffected**: every `snapshot_trigger` (and the one-per-camera startup snapshot that probes the `online` state) still opens a session, fetches the JPEG, and then — when `livestream_enabled` is `false` — closes the session right after so no proxy or watchdog stays running.
- **BlueIris recipe (forum #84538 post 14)**: VLC accepts `rtsp://user:pass@host/...` directly, BlueIris does not. To consume the stream in BlueIris, paste just `rtsp://<host>:<port>/rtsp_tunnel?…` into the address field (strip the `user:pass@` part), enter the Digest username and password in BlueIris's separate **Username / Password** fields, and set **RTSP Authentication = Digest**. Error code `8000007a (CheckPort/User/Password)` typically means BlueIris failed to apply the in-URL credentials — entering them in the dedicated fields resolves it.

### 0.5.1 (2026-05-14)
Adds Gen2 siren + RGB wallwasher colour, plus the v0.5.0 forum-driven fixes:

- **Siren** (Gen2 only): new `cameras.<id>.siren_active` boolean DP. Write `true` to trigger the integrated 75 dB siren (panic alarm), `false` to silence. Backed by `PUT /v11/video_inputs/{id}/panic_alarm` with `{status: "ON"|"OFF"}` — the same endpoint the official Bosch app uses.
- **RGB wallwasher** (Gen2 outdoor with `featureSupport.light=true`, i.e. Eyes Outdoor II): two new DPs — `cameras.<id>.wallwasher_color` (HEX `#RRGGBB`, empty string = warm white mode) and `cameras.<id>.wallwasher_brightness` (0…100). Drives both top and bottom LED groups in unison via `PUT /v11/video_inputs/{id}/lighting/switch`. The front spotlight stays untouched (controlled by `front_light_enabled` as before).
- Privacy state now syncs back from the Bosch app: every 30 s the adapter refetches `/v11/video_inputs` and mirrors `privacyMode` into `cameras.<id>.privacy_enabled`. Previously, setting privacy via the app left the ioBroker DP stale (forum #84538).
- `stream_url` now embeds Digest credentials and Bosch query params (`rtsp://<user>:<password>@host:port/rtsp_tunnel?inst=1&enableaudio=1&fmtp=1&maxSessionDuration=…`) so external recorders (BlueIris, Frigate, `iobroker.cameras`) no longer get "401 Unauthorized" on connect.
- TLS-proxy port is sticky across session renewals and adapter restarts (persisted in `cameras.<id>._proxy_port`). External recorders no longer need URL reconfiguration after each hourly Bosch session refresh.
- New admin tab "RTSP / Stream": tickbox to bind the proxy to `0.0.0.0` (instead of `127.0.0.1`) plus an external-host field so the published URL uses the ioBroker host's LAN IP — required when BlueIris / Frigate runs on a separate machine.
- Motion trigger DP description clarified: `motion_trigger` is for ioBroker-side automations only; it updates `last_motion_at` but does **not** make the Bosch app create a recording.

### 0.4.0 (2026-05-13)
- Light-datapoint split: `front_light_enabled` + `wallwasher_enabled` can now be controlled independently (e.g. a dusk sensor drives the wallwasher only, without touching the front spotlight)
- Synthetic motion trigger: write `true` to `cameras.<id>.motion_trigger` (select event type via `motion_trigger_event_type`) to inject a motion/person/audio_alarm event from an external sensor (e.g. Philips Hue in the driveway) so automations fire immediately without waiting for the Bosch FCM push
- RTSP session watchdog: LOCAL Bosch sessions renew automatically ~60 s before `maxSessionDuration` expires — BlueIris and similar 24/7 recorders no longer see an hourly stream drop
- Cloud-relay media paths fully removed: adapter enforces LOCAL-only for all media (RTSP + snapshots); if the camera is unreachable on the LAN a clear error is logged — no silent fallback to `proxy-NN.live.cbs.boschsecurity.com:42090`

Older releases (0.0.1 – 0.3.3) are archived in [CHANGELOG_OLD.md](./CHANGELOG_OLD.md).

## Status

**Beta (v0.5.1)** — verified live against 4 cameras (Gen1 + Gen2, FW 7.91.56 / 9.40.25) on a real ioBroker instance. Cloud API contracts confirmed against the iOS app via mitmproxy.

What works:
- Browser-based OAuth2 PKCE login via Bosch SingleKey ID (no programmatic password handling — captcha/MFA happen in the browser)
- Token auto-refresh (~45 min cadence; 4xx → re-login required, 5xx → silent retry). Stored `refresh_token` also used at startup to mint a fresh `access_token` silently — no PKCE re-login required after restart, even if the adapter was stopped longer than the 1 h access-token lifetime.
- Camera discovery (Gen1 + Gen2, `GET /v11/video_inputs`)
- Per-camera state tree: `name`, `firmware_version`, `hardware_version`, `generation`, `online`, `privacy_enabled`, `light_enabled`, `front_light_enabled`, `wallwasher_enabled`, `image_rotation_180`, `snapshot_trigger`, `motion_trigger`, `motion_trigger_event_type`, `snapshot_path`, `stream_url`, `last_motion_at`, `last_motion_event_type`
- Privacy toggle via Bosch Cloud API `PUT /v11/video_inputs/{id}/privacy`
- Light toggle, Gen-specific and now split into independent datapoints:
  - Gen2: `PUT /lighting/switch/front` + `/topdown`
  - Gen1: `PUT /lighting_override` (frontLightOn + wallwasherOn)
  - `front_light_enabled` and `wallwasher_enabled` can be toggled independently; `light_enabled` remains as a legacy combined switch
- Synthetic motion trigger (`motion_trigger` write-only button + `motion_trigger_event_type` selector) for external sensor integration without waiting for Bosch FCM push
- Snapshot trigger writes JPEG into the adapter file-store (`/<namespace>/cameras/<id>/snapshot.jpg`), with automatic retry on the first "stream has been aborted" hiccup that Bosch Gen2 firmware emits after idle. One startup snapshot per camera flips `cameras.<id>.online` from the default `false` to the real state immediately.
- Per-camera TLS proxy: `stream_url = rtsp://127.0.0.1:<port>/rtsp_tunnel` for use in `iobroker.cameras` or go2rtc. LOCAL-only by design — no cloud relay.
- RTSP session watchdog: LOCAL sessions renew automatically ~60 s before `maxSessionDuration` expires — 24/7 recording works without hourly stream drops
- FCM push listener (`@aracna/fcm@1.0.32` MTalk/MCS) for sub-second motion / audio-alarm / person events. `info.fcm_active` reflects state: `healthy` / `polling` / `error` / `disconnected` / `stopped`. When push registration fails the adapter falls back to `/v11/events` polling every 30 s (`info.fcm_active=polling`) — events still arrive, just with higher latency.
- Encrypted credential storage (`encryptedNative` — js-controller encrypts the refresh token at rest)
- ~320 unit tests passing

```

## Setup

1. **Install** the adapter and create an instance (the adapter starts in "waiting for login" mode).
2. **Open the adapter log** in ioBroker → Log Inspector and filter by `bosch-smart-home-camera`. Look for the line:
   ```
   Login required. Open this URL in your browser and log in to Bosch:
   https://smarthome.authz.bosch.com/auth/realms/home_auth_provider/protocol/openid-connect/auth?…
   ```
3. **Copy that URL** into a browser, log in to your Bosch SingleKey ID (solve captcha/MFA if prompted).
4. **Bosch redirects** your browser to `https://www.bosch.com/boschcam?code=…&state=…`. The page may show a blank or 404 — that is expected. Copy the full URL from the address bar.
5. **Paste the URL** into the adapter's Admin UI → "Pasted callback URL" → Save.
6. The adapter restarts, exchanges the auth code for tokens, fetches your cameras, and starts the FCM listener. Future restarts skip the browser step as long as the stored refresh token is still valid.

If the refresh token is ever rejected (after a Bosch password change or extended downtime), the adapter logs a new login URL and you repeat steps 2–5.

## Dashboard

A ready-to-import VIS-2 example dashboard is in
[`docs/vis-2-example/`](./docs/vis-2-example/) — all four cameras in a 2×2
grid with snapshot refresh (every 5 s), privacy + light toggles, snapshot
trigger button, and a status bar.

Quick install:

```bash
cp docs/vis-2-example/vis-views.json ~/iobroker-data/files/vis-2.0/main/
iobroker restart vis-2
# Open http://HOST:8082/vis-2/index.html#Cameras
```

See [`docs/vis-2-example/README.md`](./docs/vis-2-example/README.md) for the
walkthrough, including how to swap the camera UUIDs and how to wire go2rtc /
HLS for low-latency live video instead of the default snapshot refresh.

[`docs/blockly-examples/`](./docs/blockly-examples/): master-wallwasher
switch, dusk-driven auto-wallwasher via Astro, and a Philips-Hue-PIR →
synthetic Bosch motion bridge. Open javascript adapter → Scripts → new
Blockly → click the XML icon → paste. Replace `<CAM_UUID>` placeholders
with your actual camera IDs from the Objects tab. See the folder's
[README](./docs/blockly-examples/README.md) for details.

Note on **live streaming in the browser**: no browser supports RTSP natively.
The adapter publishes a per-camera `stream_url`
(`rtsp://<user>:<password>@127.0.0.1:<port>/rtsp_tunnel?…`) via a local TLS
proxy for use with ffmpeg / mpv / `iobroker.cameras` / go2rtc. For VIS
itself, either use the snapshot refresh in the example dashboard or bridge
via go2rtc → WebRTC/HLS.

### External recorders (BlueIris, Frigate)

```

By default the proxy listens on `127.0.0.1` — reachable from the ioBroker
host itself but not from another machine. To use a recorder on a separate
host:

1. Admin UI → "RTSP / Stream" tab → tick **Expose RTSP proxy to LAN**.
2. Set **External hostname / LAN IP** to the ioBroker host's LAN IP, e.g.
   `192.168.1.50`.
3. Save → adapter restarts → `cameras.<id>.stream_url` becomes
   `rtsp://<user>:<password>@192.168.1.50:<sticky-port>/rtsp_tunnel?…`.
4. Copy that URL into BlueIris / Frigate / your recorder.

The port is sticky across adapter restarts and Bosch session renewals
(persisted in `cameras.<id>._proxy_port`) — set the URL in your recorder
once and it keeps working.

## Roadmap

| Version | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| v0.6.0 | Motion zones + privacy masks (read via `/v11/video_inputs/{id}/motion`) |
| v0.7.0 | Mini-NVR: pre-roll ring buffer + local segment recording |
| v1.0.0 | VIS widget + feature parity with the HA integration |

Image rotation (v0.3.0) is a client-side display flag — Bosch's Cloud API has no rotation endpoint and RCP+ `0x0810` WRITE returns HTTP 401 on Gen2 FW 9.40.25, mirroring the HA integration's approach.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run build        # tsc → build/
npm run watch        # auto-rebuild on save
npm test             # unit tests (310 passing)
npm run lint
```

### Manual deploy to a local ioBroker test instance

```bash
SRC=$(pwd)
DST=$HOME/iobroker-test/node_modules/iobroker.bosch-smart-home-camera
rm -rf "$DST/build" && cp -r "$SRC/build" "$DST/"
cp "$SRC/io-package.json" "$DST/"
cp -r "$SRC/admin" "$DST/"
~/iobroker-test/iob upload bosch-smart-home-camera
~/iobroker-test/iob restart bosch-smart-home-camera.0
```

## Existing adapter landscape

- **[iobroker.bshb](https://github.com/holomekc/ioBroker.bshb)** — SHC Local REST API (thermostats, switches, alarms). Camera on/off only, no stream or snapshot. Active maintainer.
- **[iobroker.cameras](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.cameras)** — generic HTTP snapshot / RTSP wrapper. Pair this adapter's `stream_url` state with iobroker.cameras to get a Vis tile.
- **[iobroker.onvif](https://github.com/iobroker-community-adapters/ioBroker.onvif)** — generic ONVIF. Bosch cameras don't currently expose a local ONVIF endpoint, so this adapter is the only path for Bosch hardware.

## Release process

This adapter uses [`@alcalzone/release-script`](https://github.com/AlCalzone/release-script) for version bumps.

```bash
npm run release patch    # 0.3.0 → 0.3.1
npm run release minor    # 0.3.0 → 0.4.0
npm run release major    # 0.3.0 → 1.0.0
```

1. Builds + runs the full test suite (must pass)
2. Bumps version in `package.json` + `io-package.json`
3. Auto-generates a news entry from commits since the last release
4. Creates the `vX.Y.Z` tag and pushes — GitHub Actions auto-publishes to npm
