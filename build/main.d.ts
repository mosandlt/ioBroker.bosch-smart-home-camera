/**
 * Bosch Smart Home Camera — ioBroker Adapter
 *
 * Entry point. Authenticates against Bosch Keycloak (OAuth2 PKCE),
 * discovers cameras via the Bosch Residential Cloud API, and manages
 * ioBroker state objects for each camera entity.
 *
 * Implementation roadmap:
 *   1. [auth.ts]         OAuth2 PKCE login → access_token + refresh_token
 *   2. [cameras.ts]      GET /v11/video_inputs → camera list
 *   3. [states]          Create ioBroker state tree per camera
 *   4. [live_session.ts] Open proxy session per camera (v0.2.0)
 *   5. [tls_proxy.ts]    Register RTSPS sources as local RTSP via TLS proxy (v0.2.0)
 *   6. [fcm.ts]          FCM push registration → motion/audio/person events (stub → v0.3.0)
 *   7. [rcp.ts]          RCP+ protocol helpers (unused since v0.3.0 — all commands use Cloud API)
 *   8. [snapshot.ts]     Snapshot fetch + write to adapter file-store (v0.2.0)
 *   9. [maintenance.ts]  RSS-based cloud maintenance / outage discovery (v0.7.0)
