/**
 * Bosch Cloud — siren (panic_alarm) + Gen2 RGB lighting helpers.
 *
 * Two thin wrappers around `/v11/video_inputs/{id}/...` endpoints; isolated
 * from `main.ts` so the adapter class stays focused on state-tree wiring.
 *
 * Siren: Gen2 only, PUT /panic_alarm with {"status": "ON"|"OFF"} (204).
 *        Stateful — siren keeps blaring until OFF is sent. No GET endpoint;
 *        callers must track desired state locally.
 *
 * Lighting (Gen2 only): GET + PUT /v11/video_inputs/{id}/lighting/switch.
 *        Body shape:
 *           {
 *             frontLightSettings:     {brightness, color, whiteBalance},
 *             topLedLightSettings:    {brightness, color, whiteBalance},
 *             bottomLedLightSettings: {brightness, color, whiteBalance},
 *           }
 *        `color` (HEX "#RRGGBB") and `whiteBalance` (-1.0..1.0) are mutually
 *        exclusive per group — set one, the other goes null. PUT requires
 *        the full body in every call (the API rejects partial updates).
 *
 * References: HA integration `light.py` (_put_lighting_switch) and
 * `switch.py` (BoschPanicAlarmSwitch).
